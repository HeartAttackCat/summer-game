# Summer video game project.
No name has been established for this project as of this time.

## Statement of Intent

A text based game isn't nothing new.. I am not expecting to be the next triple AAA or award winning indie game. This project is for fun and more importantly for learning Java. *It also helps stay out of trouble. tsk tsk* Weather or not I revisit this project or continue is completely in the air after I get the first alpha version.

## Project Goals/Specifications
- **DUE DATE**: Augest 19th 2024, First alpha version
- **GRAPHICS**: Terminal Based Graphics
  - The reason for terminal based game is because the time requirment specified won't give me time to do art. As much as I(Hunter) would love to do graphics this project is more or less a jump into development and learning.
- **LANGUAGE**: Java SDK 21
  - This is to focus on code and object oritentated development. Yes this is an extreme but it also allows for easy cross platform execution. OOP(Object Orientated Programming) also tends to be a bit controversial however its application makes sense for me(Hunter) and allows myself to learn/dive into Java.
- **AUDIO**: Not for this project.
